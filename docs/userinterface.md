# User Interface

The **CMSIS Solution** extension provides the Keil Studio GUI for project management and build tools with the
[CMSIS-Toolbox](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/cmsis-toolbox/). Combined with other Arm and third-party extensions,
it implements a powerful embedded development environment.

![CMSIS view](./images/solution-outline.png)

The GUI consists of these views:

| View | Description |
|:----:|:------------|
| ![Explorer view](./images/ExplorerView.png) | [**Explorer** view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_explorer-view) lists all local files. |
| ![Search view](./images/SearchView.png) | **Search** view enables [search/replace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editing/codebasics#_search-across-files) across all files. |
| ![Source Control view](./images/SourceControlView.png) | [**Source Control** view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview) allows you to work with git. |
| ![Extensions view](./images/ExtensionsView.png) | [**Extensions** view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/configure/extensions/extension-marketplace) lets you work with VS Code extensions. |
| ![Run and Debug view](./images/RunDebugView.png) | **Run and Debug** view switches the GUI to a dedicated [debug view](./debug.md#debugger-user-interface). |
| ![CMSIS view](./images/CMSISView.png) | [**CMSIS** view](#cmsis-view) is the main view for working with CMSIS solution-based projects. |
| ![Trace and live view](./images/TraceLiveView.png) | [**Trace and Live** view](./debug.md#trace-and-live-view) shows trace and live data during debugging. |

!!! Note
    The ordering of the icons may be different in your VS Code environment.

## CMSIS view

The CMSIS view ![CMSIS icon](./images/cmsis-icon.png) shows the content of the active projects included in the
solution. Each project contains configuration settings, source code files, build settings, and other project-specific
information. The main area of the **CMSIS** view shows:

- **Board** and **device** information and related documentation.
- **Groups and files**: Groups and user files that you add to the project and that you can edit
- **constructed-files**: Contains generated files such as the `RTE_Components.h` header file for each context
- **linker**: Contains a linker script file and a &lt;regions&gt;.h file (or other user-defined header files)
- **Components**: Shows the software components selected for the project with their source files, user code templates, and
  APIs. Click the files to open them in the editor. Click the book icon of a component to open the related documentation.
  If you are using a generator to configure your device or board, then a **Run Configuration Generator** option is available to start a
  generator session.
- **Layer Type** (if available): The software layers in the project with their source files, preconfigured software
  components, and configuration files

### Actions available through the **CMSIS** view

| Action | Description |
|:------:|:------------|
| ![Build solution](./images/build-icon.png) | [**Build solution**](./build_run.md) calls the compiler toolchain and builds the solution. |
| ![Load and Run Application](./images/run-icon.png) | [**Load & Run application**](./build_run.md#load-and-run) flashes the binary onto the target and starts the application. |
| ![Load & Debug application](./images/debug-icon.png) | [**Load & Debug application**](./debug.md) flashes the binary onto the target and starts a debug session. |
| ![Open csolution.yml file](./images/openFile.png) | **Open csolution.yml file** opens the CMSIS solution YML file for editing. |
| ![Manage Solution Settings](./images/settings-cog.png) | Open the [**Manage Solution**](./manage_settings.md) view to configure project and debug settings. |
| ![Views and more actions](./images/more-actions-icon.png) | Show further [commands](#available-commands). |

### Main area icons

Depending on the file and the context, various icons may appear:

| Action | Description |
|:------:|:------------|
| ![clangd information active](./images/clangdInfo.png) | IntelliSense is active for this cproject file. |
| ![Open file](./images/openFile.png) | Open the file. |
| ![Manage software components](./images/ManageSWComonents.png) | Manage the software components of the cproject file. |
| ![Add groups or files](./images/AddGroupsFiles.png) | Add groups or files to the cproject file. |

### Configuration Wizard

[Configuration Wizard annotations](https://open-cmsis-pack.github.io/Open-CMSIS-Pack-Spec/main/html/configWizard.html)
enable GUI-like elements in IDEs for configuration source files. This graphical approach makes it easier for users
to review and edit configuration settings as required by the application.

For files containing configuration wizard annotations, open the graphical view by pressing the **Open Preview** button
![Open Preview](./images/open-conf-wiz-view-icon.png) in the top right corner of the file window.

The view will be opened next to the original source file. You can switch back pressing the **Show Source** button
![Open source file view](./images/open-source-file-view-icon.png).

![RTE_Device.h file in configuration wizard view](./images/rte-device-config-wiz-view.png)

## Status bar

The VS Code status bar displays information about the status of your development environment and the project.

- Status message of the clangd extension that provides smart features.

- You can inspect errors and warnings for the active csolution project when you move the cursor over the **Target Set** in the
  status bar. The indicator is red for errors and yellow for warnings. Click the indicator to open the
  **Output - CMSIS Solution** [panel](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/ux-guidelines/panel) and the [**Manage Solution**](./manage_settings.md) view.<br/>

    The [Arm CMSIS Debugger README](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Arm.vscode-cmsis-debugger)
    contains a more detailed description of the usage of this view.

The **Run and Debug View** ![Run and Debug view](./images/RunDebugView.png) in Keil Studio connects to the target using
the request selection shown below.

![Debug View Debugger request](./images/run-debug-view.png)

1. Select the core you want to **launch** (start an application) or **attach** to (connect to a running application).
2. Interact with the cores.

### Run and Debug controls

Depending on the target device (number of cores etc.), a similar run and debug control bar will be visible:

![Run and Debug controls](./images/debug-full-controls.png) or

![Run and Debug controls in a multicore environment](./images/debug-full-controls-multicore.png)

The icons enable access to:
